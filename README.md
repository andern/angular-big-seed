# angular-big-seed
This is an application skeleton for big AngularJS applications. Similar to
[angular-seed](//github.com/angular/angular-seed), but a more modular approach.

## Modules
Applications are split into several modules, where each module represents some
logically separated part of the application. A module should stand alone from
the rest of the applications, so that they can easily be shared. A module might
depend on several other modules though, in which case they must always be
shared together.
